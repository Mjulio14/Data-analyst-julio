Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Oxford Insight Dataset

Project Title: Analyzing Performance Scores Across Continents: An Exploratory Data Analysis

Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Oxford Insight dataset, with a focus on understanding trends and patterns in performance scores across continents. By analyzing different indicators such as government pillars, technology sectors, and GDP per capita, we aim to gain insights into what influences high performance in different regions.

Dataset: The Oxford Insight dataset contains various country performance indicators, including:

• Country: The name of each country analyzed.
• Global Ranking (2023): The country's global ranking in 2023.
• Total score (2023): The total performance score for the country in 2023.
• Government Pillar (2023): The score for the government sector in 2023.
• Technology Sector Pillar (2023): The score for the technology sector in 2023.
• Data & Infrastructure Pillar (2023): The score for data and infrastructure in 2023.
• Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP) (2023): Foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP for 2023.
• GDP per capita (current US$) (2023): The gross domestic product per capita in current US dollars for 2023.
• Gross domestic savings (% of GDP) (2023): The gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP for 2023.
• Gross fixed capital formation (% of GDP) (2023): The gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP for 2023.
• Gross fixed capital formation (current US$) (2023): The gross fixed capital formation in current US dollars for 2023.
• Mobile cellular subscriptions (2023): The number of mobile cellular subscriptions in 2023.
• Regulatory Quality: Estimate (2023): An estimate of the quality of regulations in 2023.
• Global Position (2022): The global position of the country in 2022.
• Total score (2022): The total performance score for the country in 2022.
• Government Pillar (2022): The score for the government sector in 2022.
• Technology Sector Pillar (2022): The score for the technology sector in 2022.
• Data & Infrastructure Pillar (2022): The score for data and infrastructure in 2022.
• Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP) (2022): Foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP for 2022.
• GDP per capita (current US$) (2022): The gross domestic product per capita in current US dollars for 2022.
• Gross domestic savings (% of GDP) (2022): The gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP for 2022.
• Gross fixed capital formation (% of GDP) (2022): The gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP for 2022.
• Gross fixed capital formation (current US$) (2022): The gross fixed capital formation in current US dollars for 2022.
• Mobile cellular subscriptions (2022): The number of mobile cellular subscriptions in 2022.
• Regulatory Quality: Estimate (2022): An estimate of the quality of regulations in 2022.
• Global Position (2021): The global position of the country in 2021.
• Overall Score (2021): The overall performance score for the country in 2021.
• Government (2021): The score for the government sector in 2021.
• Technology Sector (2021): The score for the technology sector in 2021.
• Data & Infrastructure Pillar (2021): The score for data and infrastructure in 2021.
• Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP) (2021): Foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP for 2021.
• GDP per capita (current US$) (2021): The gross domestic product per capita in current US dollars for 2021.
• Gross domestic savings (% of GDP) (2021): The gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP for 2021.
• Gross fixed capital formation (% of GDP) (2021): The gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP for 2021.
• Gross fixed capital formation (current US$) (2021): The gross fixed capital formation in current US dollars for 2021.
• Mobile cellular subscriptions (2021): The number of mobile cellular subscriptions in 2021.
• Regulatory Quality: Estimate (2021): An estimate of the quality of regulations in 2021.

Methodology:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Load the Oxford Insight dataset using Python libraries like Pandas.

![ ](https://github.com/Mjulio14/Data-analyst-julio/blob/main/Images/Data%20Collection%20and%20Data%20Cleaning.jpg)

Perform initial data cleaning, which includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring clarity in column names

Descriptive Statistics:

Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for numerical features like Total Scores and GDP per capita.
Count the missing values and calculate their proportion across columns to identify gaps in the data.

Data Visualization:

Histograms and Boxplots: Analyze the distribution of continuous variables such as government pillar scores and technology sector scores.
Bar Charts: Display performance differences across continents, focusing on overall scores and specific pillars.
Heatmaps: Visualize correlations between numerical variables like GDP, government pillar, and technology sector.

Performance Analysis:

By Continent: Compare average performance scores across continents, highlighting top and low performers.
By Pillars: Investigate how key pillars like Government and Technology affect overall country performance.
By GDP per Capita: Examine how economic factors such as GDP per capita relate to overall country performance.

Insights and Findings:

Summarize key findings based on data visualizations and statistical analyses, such as identifying higher performance in certain continents or the importance of government and technology pillars in influencing total scores.

Conclusion:

Discuss the broader implications of the findings, such as the potential policy focus for underperforming regions or the need for further analyses, like predictive models to forecast performance scores based on various indicators.

Tools and Technologies:

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and documentation of steps.
Optional: Tableau or Power BI for advanced visualizations and presentation.
Deliverables:

A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook documenting all steps of the analysis, with code, visualizations, and explanations of findings.
A presentation summarizing key insights and visualizations, suitable for stakeholders or peers.
